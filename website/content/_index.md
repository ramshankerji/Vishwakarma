Picking up pace for fast and continuous improvement.

Join us to improve the module useful for your field of expertise. This website is our home page. All the documentations and user manuals shall be added here. This website is developed like a book, where you can read chapter by chapter. In future we will have dedicated tutorial section as well. All the coding (software development) related design documents are also published here. It is free open source  Made-In-India software.

**Current Status of Mission Vishwakarma**  
As on 2024, all modules are in planning stage and under preliminary design by Ram Shanker. This road is full of challenges. Technical and Non-Technical both. Once we have Minimum Functionality available in each of the modules, software shall be opened for general public  participation and contribution of their improvement. Till than, all code behind this software may be considered property of my employer.
