Some 101 lessons on how to use the software. Here we list all the mouse and keyboard shortcuts.

We took initial inspiration from Blender software, adopting it for CAD application.

**Mouse**
* Middle wheel Rotation / Scroll : (3D) Zoom In / Zoom Out towards current focus center.
* Middle wheel Press + Scroll : (3D) Rotate around the current focus center.
* If operating purely from the laptop scroll pad where middle wheel is absent, press ALT + Left Mouse button in place of Middle Mouse button control listed above.
* Shift + Middle wheel Press + Scroll : (3D) PAN around.
* Rotate only camera direction is not yet developed.

**Keyboard**
We shall list all the keyboard shortcuts here.

**3D Connection Mouse**
One day this will also be supported.

**VR Headset Inputs**
Oh yes. These ones too will be supported in future. Teach us how to support them.

**Brain Computer Interface**
Waiting for Elon Musk's Neuralink to develop the controller first !
