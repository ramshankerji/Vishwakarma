Download And Install the software.

This website is written like a mega-book. Ideally you should read the 1st 2 chapters line by line. Subsequently you can jump to your domain / department specific volume of the book.

Those interested in developing the software further, or just curious about the software-design principles to be followed, jump to software chapter. Remember our Users come first. Software is written for Engineers (our users.). They always have higher priority here. ;)
