## Philosophy
Downloadable software is FREE and will remain FREE forever. We are not just another commercial For-Profit corporation, trying to extract as much "value" as possible out of our paying customer. We expect that you will pay for this software by your feedback, suggestions, expertise, software crash dumps, usage logs etc. 

Even better, if you can allocate some man power towards development of this software. All developments will benefit everyone.

## Donations
We may in future, ask for donations to be able to allocate dedicated resource for software development and hosting infrastructure. Right now ( as of Jan 2026 ) , we don't seek any monetary contribution. Your time and words are more valuable to us. Donations and Sponsorship will remain our primary revenue stream, whenever we decide to take monetary contribution.

## Support
If you need to contact someone for software support, we have failed somewhere. It's that simple. Maybe the software itself was not good enough. Maybe our documentation was incomplete. Maybe our training material was not enough !

We will have a public forum soon, for coordinating community support. Having said that, if you still need someone to reach out to, and want someone to immediately respond to a mission critical issue, that person will have to be paid. Therefore once we are a bit mature stage, and people actively start using our software, we will offer Paid Support plans. However, we don't expect these Paid support plans to be our primary revenue source.

## Service
Once we have software in active use, many people will have enough knowhow to provide expert guidance. We will assist with organizing Mission Vishwakarma experts.

## What else?
We are still figuring it out. Your suggestions welcome.
