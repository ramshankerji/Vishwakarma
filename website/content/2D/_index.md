Here we deal with 2D Drawings. 2D drawings have traditionally been just a digital version of a sheet of paper.

Subsequently many disciplines started developing certain conventions to encode domain specific information through their own exclusive practices.

We intend to develop following minimum featureset in our application for 2D applications.

Objects:  
Line / Linetype  
Circle / Elipse  
Arcs / Nurbs 
Polylines  
Text (B/I/U,Sub,Sup)  
Paragraph (Bullets, Lists, Offsets)
