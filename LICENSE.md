May Lord Vishwakarma enlighten you to create a beautiful world, happy homes and safe infrastructure for the nation. Remember, it is our duty and responsibility as Engineers to create safe structures, machines and factories. We engineers must follow all the National Codes, Building Codes, Safety Codes, local By-Laws and so on. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR CREATION.  

Currently this software and its source codes may be considered property of my employer, even tough this project is being developed by me (Ram Shanker) in my personal time and laptop. Once there is enough development to show to management, I intend to take formal approval for open source collaboration with the industry and academia using AGPLv3 license. Dependencies (in folder code-external) used in the software have their own licenses.  

For the reasons explained above, source-code contribution (pull request in github terminology) are not accepted yet. Till the time I receive approval for AGPLv3, all contributors, agree to transfer the copyright of their contribution (including but not limited to code, documentation, know-how etc.) to Ram Shanker on free, perpetual & ir-revocable basis.  

It is to be noted that even though this software is free, many engineering design codes are not free / public domain document. You agree to obtain separate authorization / purchase the code from respective standards body.

ALL ENGINEERING MODELS CREATED USING THIS SOFTWARES REMAIN PROPERTY OF THE RESPECTIVE ENGINEER / ORGANIZATION.

This software is made possible by the Great Open Source Authors of following libraries.
